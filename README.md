### Installation and Dataset

Clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:fraunhoferhhi/R3GW.git
cd R3GW
```
Create the environment:
```
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate R3GW
```
Install manually nvdiffrast:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/NVlabs/nvdiffrast.git --no-build-isolation
```
To train and evaluate our model we used the version of the [NeRF-OSR](https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/NeRF-OSR/) dataset provided by [LumiGauss](https://lumigauss.github.io/), which can be downloaded [here](https://zenodo.org/records/15455694).

Dataset available at [Dataset](https://nextcloud.mpi-klsb.mpg.de/index.php/s/mGXYKpD8raQ8nMk?dir=%2FData).

Our model requires sky masks for training. For each scene, these masks must be generated in advance and stored in a floder named `sky_masks` within the directory `undistorted`. We generated the sky masks from the segmentation masks provided by [NeuSky](https://github.com/JADGardner/neusky).

## Usage
The script `run_all.sh` contains instructions to train, render, and evaluate all scenes, while `run_relighting.sh` provides a relighting example.
